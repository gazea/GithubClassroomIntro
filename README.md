# Github Classroom Intro
Github Classroom is a new and innovative way for students to interact with coding. It enables *automatic grading* of assignments, with *instant feedback* regarding code outputs and layout/readability of code. By joining the classroom, a unique copy of this file repository is made for you - you can upload files, correct the code already provided (which will be the main aim of this test), and familiarise yourself with Github.

# Files found in this repository
In this repository are a few folders: .github contains all of the files regarding the workflow for testing your code, written in a combination of Bash and Javascript; sources contains the code that you will be correcting as part of this test; tests contains the code that will be executed to check the output and *style* of your code; and finally, README.md contains all of the text that you are currently reading. 

# Your task: correct circle.py
Currently, at the top of the repository will be a red cross. This indicates that the test being run is failing. By clicking on it, you will be able to see the details of why the test fails - the output of the code is incorrect. However, the test for the code style will pass.

Correct circle.py so that it returns the circumference of a circle, rounded to 3 decimal places. Remember: the formula for the circumference of a circle is pi multiplied by the diameter.
