# Github Classroom Intro
Github Classroom is a new and innovative way for students to interact with coding. It enables *automatic grading* of assignments, with instant feedback regarding code outputs and layout/readability of code. By joining the classroom, a unique copy of this file repository is made for you - you can upload files, correct the code already provided (which will be the main aim of this test), and familiarise yourself with Github.

# Files found in this repository
In this repository are 3 files: README.md, which contains all of the text that you are currently reading; hello.py, the code that you need to correct; and test.py, which will test whether hello.py is producing the correct output. All code is run on a remote Linux machine provided by Github, meaning that your computer does not need to do any of the processing.

# Your task: correct hello.py
Currently, at the top of the repository will be a red cross. This indicates that the test being run is failing.
